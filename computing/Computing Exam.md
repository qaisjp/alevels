Fundamentals of problem solvilng, why do we use computers, stages of problem solving, goals, ownership, givens, resources and constraints..

Different types iof problem s0olving, top down desigtn/step-wise refinement

Decision tables



Finite State Machines
------------
- State transition diagrams
- State transition tables
!!!


Algorithms
----------
Write on the question paper gadammit! It makes it easier to understand!!!!!!!1
For trace tables, try and write on the line where somethnig happens, so it's clearer.

Don't waste ypouir time filling in repeated infomation in the trace table, if something dowens't change then leave a blank space until it changes bruh

You need to know bubble sort (and linear search, but please, that's some easy "shtuff") - it's awesome!


Pseudo code
-----------
NON PROGRAM SPECIFIC! YOU SHOULDN'T USE DOT TERMINOLOGY



Why do we use functions and procedures? Because it keeps things dry, not wet.
NEVER SAY "it's faster, more efficient, better, blah, longer, harder" without explaining why.


Data validation
--------------
It only checks that a value is "appropriate", it doesn't actually check if you're 18 and over ;) But it know's your stuffing if you say you're a 180yo ;)
