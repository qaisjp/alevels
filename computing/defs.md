* Hardware: A physical component of a computer system (old specification: a piece of a computer you can kick!)
* Software: A set of instructions that are designed to run on the hardware
* Translater software
  * A *compiler* compiles executable code (no access to the code once it has been compiled, use it once it is ready to distribute)
  * *Assembler* is used for the assembly language
  * *Interpreter*: used for debugging - it goes through line by line of your code and runs it at that point

* Generational languages:
 * 101010010101010 - **1st generation**
 * MOV, STORE, ADD (Assembly, uses mnemomomics momomomo) - **2nd gen** 
 * High level languages liek the Lua magics, the VB poo poo's, the C++ goodness - **3rd**
 * SQL is a fourth gen, basically it dunt make magic stuff, it does things to things - **4th**
 * (Theoretically, not in the spec) - "i tell you do this. it do that. monkey c monkey do" - **5th**
