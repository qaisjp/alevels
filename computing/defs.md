* Hardware: A physical component of a computer system (old specification: a piece of a computer you can kick!)
* Software: A set of instructions that are designed to run on the hardware

* Translater software
  * A *compiler* compiles executable code (no access to the code once it has been compiled, use it once it is ready to distribute)
  * *Assembler* is used for the assembly language
  * *Interpreter*: used for debugging - it goes through line by line of your code and runs it at that point
