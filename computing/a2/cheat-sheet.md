There are **two** measures used to describe the complexity of an algorithm:
* *time complexity*, and
* *space complexity*

**Tree traversals**:
* In order tree traversal (this is in descending order)
* Reverse in order tree traversal (this is in ascending order)
* Breadth first (not in order)
* Depth first (not in order)

Decision:
*  **tree**: an undirected graph with no cycles
*  **rooted tree**:
*  ****:
