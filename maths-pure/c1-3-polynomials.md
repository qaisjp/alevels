Sketching curves
----------------
* If we get asked to sketch the curve *y=x<sup>3></sup>-3x<sup>2</sup>-x+3*, we need to find the three roots.
* The roots in *y = (x+1)(x-1)(x-3)* are *x=-1*, *x=1* and *x=3*.
* We know the general "feel" of the curve, and we know that the y-intercept is **3**, so we can sketch the curve.

Factor Theorem
---------------
If `(x-a)` is a factor of `f(x)`, then `f(a) = 0`; and `x=a` is a root of the equation `f(x) = 0`.

Remainder Theorem
-----------------
`f(a)` is the remainder when `f(x)` is divided by `(x-a)`
