Sketching curves
----------------
* If we get asked to sketch the curve *y=x<sup>3></sup>-3x<sup>2</sup>-x+3*, we need to find the three roots.
* The roots in *y = (x+1)(x-1)(x-3)* are *x=-1*, *x=1* and *x=3*.
* We know the general "feel" of the curve, and we know that the y-intercept is **3**, so we can sketch the curve.
