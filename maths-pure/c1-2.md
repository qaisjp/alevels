Co-ordinate geometry
====

* Gradient between two points: ![m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)](http://qs.lc/dqgh5)
* Distance between two points: ![sqrt\[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2\]](http://qs.lc/u7sjd)
* Midpoint of line joining two points ![(x1+x2/2, y1+y2/2)](http://qs.lc/ig02x)
* Finding equation of line: **y-y<sub>1</sub> = m(x-x<sub>1</sub>)**
* Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect and ![m<sub>1</sub> = -1/m<sub>2</sub>](http://qs.lc/hwnsa)

Circles
-------
* centre(a,b), radius *r*: **(x-a)<sup>2</sup> + (y-b)<sup>2</sup> = r<sup>2</sup>**
* angle in a semi-circle is a right angle
* radius to chord is a perpendicular bisector (chord = line between two points on circle)
* tangent to circle is a perpendicular bisector to the radius
